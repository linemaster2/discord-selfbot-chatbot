# discord-selfbot-chatbot
Discord selfbot chatbot fully written in nodej, powered by c.ai.


if you want to use Guest login Instead of token login, set the loginType in config.json to the string "Guest" instead of "Token"

To run this you will need nodejs of course and the discord.js-selfbot-v13 library, so run 
```
npm i discord.js-selfbot-v13@latest
```
in your terminal.

i did not make the node_characterai module, full credits go the [https://github.com/realcoloride](owner)

you can find the original module on this [https://www.npmjs.com/package/node_characterai(link) even tho i didnt really modify anything.
